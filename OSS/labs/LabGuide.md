## Nginx Ingress Controller Workshop

<br/>

### Overview

Welcome to the Nginx Workshop for Nginx Ingress Controller (NIC)!

</br>

This Workshop will introduce the Open Source version of the `Nginx Ingress Controller` with hands-on practice through self-paced lab exercises.  You will learn how to deploy an Nginx Ingress Controller on a Kubernetes cluster, configure basic and advanced Nginx features; and then test it, and monitor it in realtime.

The Hands-On Lab Exercises are designed to build upon each other, adding additional services and features as you progress through them.  

`It is important to complete the lab exercises in sequential order.`

By the end of this Workshop, you will have a working, operational Nginx Ingress Controller, with the skills to deploy and operate one for your Digital Enterprise Kubernetes projects.
